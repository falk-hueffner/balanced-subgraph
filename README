This package contains the source and the test data for a solver for
the Sign Consistent Subgraph poblem, based on data reduction rules and
iterative compression. It is described in the paper:

  Optimal Solutions for the Sign-Consistent Subgraph Problem
  Manuscript, January 2007.


Graph Bipartization solver
==========================

The purpose is to solve the [...]

The current version can be obtained at
http://theinf1.informatik.uni-jena.de/scs/. It is distributed under
the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL, see COPYING).

The solver is written in Objective Caml and ISO C99. To build the
program, you need Objective Caml (version 3.08 or newer), the GNU gcc
compiler (version 3.2 or newer) and GNU make. Using other compilers or
makes, or building on a non-Unix system, will probably require changes
to the Makefile and the source.

It has been tested on:

* Debian GNU/Linux (i386) 3.1 with Objective Caml 3.08.3 and gcc 3.3.5
  (Debian 1:3.3.5-13)

The program is called "ulp". By default, it reads a graph from
standard input and writes it to standard output (note that on Unix
systems, you can close standard input from the keyboard with
Control-d). The graph format is a simple text format, where each line
describes one edge, given by its two endpoints separated by
whitespace, plus an optional edge label (0 or 1):

v0 v1 1
v1 v2
v2 v0 0

Vertex names can be any combination of letters, digits, and _. Note
that this graph format cannot describe degree-0 vertices; however,
they are irrelevant for the Sign Consistent Subgraph poblem
anyway. Label "0" indicates an edge that demands that the coloring of
its endpoints are equal, and "1" demands that the coloring of its
endpoints are unequal. Default is "1".

The output is a minimum set of edges C to delete to make the graph
sign consistent. Example:

$ ./ulp < test/rand02.graph
0 10 1
1 8 0
4 6 0
7 17 0
9 10 0
11 17 1
13 14 0

Option "-c" controls the size of cuts sought for in the data reduction
rules. Default is 4.

With -s, one gets only a single line of output containing some
statistics:

   n      m     k     runtime [s]
  193    493    12       0.26


Here, k is size of solution.

ILP based solver
================

The Python script "ulp-lp" solves SCS by calling the ILP solver
"glpsol" from the glpk package
(http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html). It has been tested with
glpk 4.8.


Test data
=========

The directory "test" contains some random test instances.
