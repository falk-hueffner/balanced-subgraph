(** Directed network flow. Having both arcs (x, y) and (y, x) present
    will probably confuse some functions.  *)

(** The type of a flow network.  *)
type t

(** [make g cap] creates a flow network from [g], where arc [(i, j)]
    has capacity [cap i j]. O(m) time. *)
val make : Digraph.t -> (int -> int -> int) -> t

(** [influx g i] returns the total outflow minus the total inflow at
    [i] in [g].  *)
val influx : t -> int -> int

(** [augment g s t] tries to find an augmenting path from [s] to [t]
    in [g] and then augments the flow along it. If no such path exists, g
    is returned unchanged. O(m) time.  *)
val augment : t -> int -> int -> t

(** [output c g] prints a debug representation of [g] to channel [c].
    O(m) time.  *)
