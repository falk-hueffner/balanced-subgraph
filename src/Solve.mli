(** Solve the SCS problem. Returns a coloring with minimum number of
    conflict edges.  *)
val solve : Bsg.t -> bool IntMap.t

(** [solve_all_colorings g c] optimally solves SCS under all possible
    colorings of the vertices in [c], except that (because of symmetry)
    the highest vertex in [c] is always colored 0. Returns a map of the
    optimal colorings, where the keys are binary representation of the
    coloring of [c].  *)
