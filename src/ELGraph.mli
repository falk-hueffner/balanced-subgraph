(** Edge-labeled undirected functional graphs. Vertices are represented
    by nonnegative integers. No multiple edges are possible (but
    self-loops are).  *)

(** The type of a graph, parameterized by the edge label type.  *)
type 'a t

(** The empty graph.  *)
val empty : 'a t

(** [neighbors g i] returns a map that maps neighbors of [i] in [g] to
    the corresponding edge label. Raises [Not_found] if [i] is not in [g].
    O(log n) time.  *)
val neighbors : 'a t -> int -> 'a IntMap.t

(** [new_vertex g] returns [g', i], where [g'] is [g] with an
    additional new vertex [i]. O(log n) time.  *)
val new_vertex : 'a t -> 'a t * int

(** [connect g v w] returns [g] with vertices [v] and [w] connected.
    Raises [Not_found] when [v] or [w] do not exist in [g]. Raises
    [IntMap.Already_present] when [v] and [w] are already connected. O(log
    n) time.  *)
val connect : 'a t -> int -> int -> 'a -> 'a t

(** [fold_edges f g a] computes [(f iN jN ... (f i1 j1 a)...)], where
    [(i1, j1) ... (iN, jN)] are the edges of [g]. O(m) time.  *)

(** [iter_edges f g] calls [f u v] for each edge [(u, v)] in
    [g]. O(m) time.  *)
val iter_edges : (int -> int -> 'a -> unit) -> 'a t -> unit

(** [output c output_label g] prints a debug representation of [g] to
    channel [c]. O(m) time.  *)
