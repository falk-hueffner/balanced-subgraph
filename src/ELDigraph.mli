(** The empty graph.  *)

(** [make g f] creates a labeled graph from an unlabeled graph [g]
    where [(i, j)] is labeled [f i j].  *)

(** [has_arc g i j] returns true if there is an arc from [i] to
    [j]. Raises [Not_found] when [i] or [j] are not in [g]. *)

(** [get_label g i j] returns the label of the arc [(i, j)]. Raises
    [Not_found] when [i] or [j] are not in [g]. *)

    successors of [i] in [g]. *)

    O(log n) time.  *)
